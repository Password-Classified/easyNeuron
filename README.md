**Note:** this is an unfinished project, so should not be used yet.
<br/>

***easyNeuron*** is the new Python module for creating deep learning algorithms and artificial
neural networks started by [Password-Classified](https://github.com/Neuron-AI) in 2021. Equipped with datasets to get you started, functions for the calculus and
maths so you don't have to and with infinite model configurations for you to use, ***easyNeuron*** is ready for all your data science projects. Find ***easyNeuron*** at it's [Github Repository](https://github.com/Neuron-AI/easyNeuron), with a GitHub.io website coming soon!

<br/>
<br/>

## Thank you! 🎉
I'd link to thank those who have helped make this happen...

- [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](https://github.com/naturalis) and [their DNA database](https://github.com/naturalis/Custom-databases-DNA-sequences). Find their website [here](https://www.naturalis.nl/). They kindly let me include their database in the module [here](https://github.com/naturalis/Custom-databases-DNA-sequences/issues/10).
- Also, a big thanks to all of the fantastic contributors so far:
