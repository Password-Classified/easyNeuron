# Thank you! ðŸŽ‰
I'd link to thank those who have helped make this happen...

 + [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](https://github.com/naturalis) and [their DNA database](https://github.com/naturalis/Custom-databases-DNA-sequences). Find their website [here](https://www.naturalis.nl/). They kindly let me include their database in the module [here](https://github.com/naturalis/Custom-databases-DNA-sequences/issues/10).
