# easyNeuron
`easyNeuron` is a lightweight neural network framework written in Python for Python as one file, but other folders contain datasets
and resources for learning and using machine learning. It only uses Python Standard Library modules - not even numpy - to program it.

This is a very community driven project, so please report any bugs that we can iron out;
we want to make this the best we can. It is also under constant heavy development, so
please provide feedback for any issues you come accross

# Thank you! ðŸŽ‰
I'd link to thank those who have helped make this happen...

 + [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](https://github.com/naturalis) and [their DNA database](https://github.com/naturalis/Custom-databases-DNA-sequences). Find their website [here](https://www.naturalis.nl/).

## **Installation**
To install `easyNeuron`, you can simply use pip, with the command:
```
py -m pip install easyneuron
```

<br/>
<br/>

## **Exceptions**
`easyNeuron` uses the basic built-in exceptions that are in the Standard Library.
As well as them, `easyNeuron` has its own exceptions for comprehensive error messages to make your workflow faster.

## **Classes**

<br/>

### **Layers**
>***Layer(n_inputs, n_neurons)***
- `n_inputs` = number of inputs (from data or previous layer)
- `n_neurons` = number of neurons (will also equate to number of biases)

Parent class of all layers, containing the dunder/magic methods for all layers.

<br/>

>***Layer_Dense(n_inputs, n_neurons)***
- `n_inputs` = integer of inputs (from data or previous layer)
- `n_neurons` = integer of neurons (will also equate to number of biases)

Dense layer, fully connected.

>>*forward(inputs)*
 - `inputs` = `list` or `tuple` of data/output of previous layer

Runs the *Layer_Dense* object forwards (forwardpropagating the dense layer).

## **Classmethods**

<br/>

> ***Matrix***

Classmethods for matrix operations such as dot products and transposing.

>>*dot(list_1, list_2)*
 - `list_1` and `list_2` = 2 lists to find the dot product between.

Returns the dot product as a `list`/`matrix` between the 2 lists. I am not using `numpy` for this, so I must write my own.

>>*transpose(matrix)*
 - `matrix` = input a `matrix` (list of lists)

Returns the matrix transposed - columns become rows and rows become columns. Another numpy method I am not using, so this is one I've written myself.
