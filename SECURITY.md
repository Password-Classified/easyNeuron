## Reporting a Vulnerability

Currently, there are a few main options.
 - You could post it as a discussion in the discussions area
 - You could raise an issue on [the repository](https://github.com/Neuron-AI/easyNeuron/issues).


## What Happens to Your Report

It will be read by a member of our team and checked against
our code. We will try to fix any issues, but this is just a
small project for the creators. It may take a while. For this
reason, it may not be best for all projects, especially large
scale deployments. If the project is popular enough, it will be
maintained better and by more contributors.
